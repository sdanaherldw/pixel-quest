THE WORLD WILL REMEMBER THE LAST WINTER OF FROSTFANG!",

I thought I was eternal. *a rumbling chuckle* Perhaps that was my mistake. You fought well, little ones. Better than the dwarves. Better than anyone. In my hoard... beneath the frozen gold... there is something that does not belong to this mountain. Something from below. It whispers of fire... and chains... and something that should never be freed. Heed my warning... and be wary of what burns beneath the earth..."
