His eyes are twin furnaces of cold green fire, and in his skeletal hand he clutches a staff topped with a phylactery that pulses with the trapped souls of ten thousand dead. He does not hate the living — he pities them. Every plague he spreads, every corpse he raises, every soul he binds is an act of what he genuinely believes is mercy: freeing them from the suffering of mortal life.",

Ten thousand souls. Farmers, soldiers, mothers, children. All freed from the agony of mortal existence. No more hunger. No more disease. No more grief. *turns, green fire blazing in hollow eye sockets* I was a healer once. I watched patients die — slowly, painfully, begging for mercy I couldn't give. Now I CAN give it.

You would condemn these souls back to suffering? *raises his staff, and the bodies of your fallen allies begin to twitch and rise* Then let me show you what your 'heroism' truly costs. RISE!

Do you think I CHOSE to become this? I was a HEALER! I just... I couldn't stop healing. I couldn't let anyone suffer. Not one. Not EVER.

A little girl with river fever. I held her hand and promised I would make it better. I lied. *smiles sadly* I've been trying to keep that promise ever since. Was it worth it? Three hundred years of death to cure death itself? *the green fire dims* I think... I think I always knew it wasn't. I just couldn't stop. *reaches toward the streaming souls* Forgive me. All of you.
