Before your sun, before your stars, before the concept of warmth existed — there was ME. I warmed the first hands. I lit the first dawn. I taught your ancestors to cook, to forge, to build. *the fire flickers, and for one moment the figure looks almost sad* And then they feared me. They chained me.

The corruption in your forests, the madness in your mountains, the plague in your swamps — all of it flows from ME! From my RAGE! From ten thousand years of BETRAYAL!

I LOVED THEM! *the fire becomes tears — literal tears of flame cascading from something that might be eyes* AND THEY LOCKED ME IN A HOLE! For TEN THOUSAND YEARS I have burned ALONE! No more!

Every mortal who ever lived. Every hand I ever warmed. Even you. Especially you. *the fire blazes one final time* If this is the end... then let it be GLORIOUS!

I was just... a spark. A little light in the darkness, trying to make the world warm. *the flame flickers* Tell them... tell them the first fire remembers. Tell them it was never meant to burn. It was meant to... to comfort. To guide. To... *the flame dims, then steadies — and does not go out. It hovers there, warm and gentle, waiting to be carried* ...to hope."
